# Welcome to My GitHub Pages

This is the central hub for my projects and experiments hosted on GitHub Pages. Here you can find a collection of my work ranging from small scripts to larger projects in various domains of computer science and software development.

## My Projects

Below is a list of projects that I've worked on and made available for public view. Feel free to explore them!

### OpenAI Chat

A Python script that interacts with the OpenAI API to generate conversational AI responses based on user input. It simulates a chat environment where the AI responds thoughtfully to each message.

### 30 Day Make OS

The code in the book "30 Days of OS Development" is developed in a Windows environment using the author's custom tools. The goal of this project is to enable the code from the book to run and be verified in Linux/macOS environments (including both x86 and ARM CPUs, such as Intel/AMD CPUs and Raspberry Pi). Additionally, a 31st day has been added to the original 30 days for cleaning up various compilation warnings in the source code and for optimization.

### Private repos

#### Vocab Ahead

Vocab-Ahead is a tool designed to help readers improve their vocabulary by marking unknown words in English books. Users can input a PDF file, and the software generates a list of words from the text, allowing them to mark unfamiliar words. These marked words are then saved in a database for later review and study.
